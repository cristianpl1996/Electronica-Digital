Simulator is doing circuit initialization process.
Finished circuit initialization process.
ERROR: at 300 ns(10000): Iteration limit 10000 is reached. Possible zero delay oscillation detected where simulation can not advance in time because signals can not resolve to a stable value in File "C:/Users/Cristian/Documents/ISE/LatchSR_ActivoBajo/LatchSR_AA_EN_AA.vhd" Line 55. Please correct this code in order to advance past the current simulation time.

INFO: Simulator is stopped.
